# gtfs-static
created as part of "Praktikum Algorithmen" (TU Darmstadt, summer semester 2020)

## Notes
```
* All data will be reset on page reloading.
  So do not reload, if you don't want to reset everything - or just save your changes before.

* All realtime data will be reset after creating or loading a static dataset.
  So you have to save all changes before doing this over the menu, if you want to.

* The file 'public/gtfs-static.xml' will only be used to generate gtfs structures, when serving the project.
  In production mode a constant string created from it will be used instead - because of same-origin-policy.
  Keep that in mind, when changing this file. (see mounted function in 'src/App.vue' for more information)
  Solving the SOP problem, allows you to delete this string and always use the human readable file instead.

* Python script for generating 'public/gtfs-static.xml' using the 'Google transit APIs' website can be found
  in the folder 'tools'. Note that enumerations are still given static. (see file 'tools/enumerations.xml')
  In order to use this script, make sure you have installed the python modules: beautifulsoup, lxml.
  
* Any trip update in a loaded realtime feed should have a non-empty start day inside the trip descriptor.
  Trip updates created by this app will always have this value - which is needed to compute times for the ui.
